why should we test : 
testing increases confidence in changing/ maintaining code and
fixing a bug easier.

Unit testing :
Unit testing is a process in which
you divide your application to the smallest parts posible. 
and then test every one of them, 
as a independed unit.  


 Integration testing : 
 Integration testing, also known as integration and testing (I&T), is a software development process which program units are combined and tested as groups in multiple ways. 

 why should we use integration testing  : 
 Integration testing can expose problems with the interfaces among program components before trouble occurs in real-world program execution. 

 There are two major ways of carrying out tesing : 

  bottom-up - testing begins with unit testing,followed by testing
  biger and biger combinations of code.  
  top-down - first you test the highest level modules and the you go down to smaller and smaller part.
